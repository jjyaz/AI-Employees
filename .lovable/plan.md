## Change
Remove the line "This project was built with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev)." from the License & Credits section at the bottom of `README.md`.

## Technical Details
- Edit `README.md` near the end of the file
- Remove only that specific sentence while keeping the rest of the License & Credits section intact
